# Extracting data from "Books to Scrape"

This is a project done as part of my degree program at Openclassrooms.

It involves extracting data from the "[Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/)" website and storing them in a csv file. Also download and save the image file for each product page.

## Create a virtual environment

Requirement : Python3.3 or later

Open terminal at the root of the project directory, and enter the following command:

    python -m venv <name of the virtual environment>

For example:

    python -m venv env

This will create a directory named *env* inside your project directory.

## Activate the virtual environment

In the project directory, open a terminal and enter the following command:

    source <name of the virtual environment>/bin/activate

## Execute the python script

In your terminal inside the project directory:

    python P2_01_extract-product-data.py
